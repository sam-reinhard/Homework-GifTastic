# Homework-GifTastic

This is a homework assignment that was aimed at helping us become fluent in using APIs by incoporating data from the API into our webpage. For this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to create buttons that would populate the page with 10 GIFs that are associated with the string on the button. Additionally, the user can input their own text into the form on the right side of the page to create their own buttons and subsequently run their own searches.
